I'm Austin Jones a software engineer from Tennessee.
I like using cool technology to solve cool problems.
Thus far I've worked up and down the stack: from distributed container apps to bare metal embedded.
If the problem's cool I'll work on it!.

Away from the technical stuff.
I have two beloved cats: Tofu and Miso.
I enjoy staying active with climbing and running.
I like to read and run a book club!
