# Is a realist just a pessimist:

- 4oz of water is in the cup
- could processes improve vs can we improve process
    + could processes improve
        * "yeah"
        * "yeah"
    + can we improve process
        * "yea and we should work to do so"
        * "yea but we haven't seen anyone do anything"


# Working w/ Realists

- Accepting situations as they are while working to change them.

    Dialectical Behavioral Therapy

- Give people the space to be who they are w/o disrupting your flow and method.

    Pessimism is fine(ish), but useing diengagement as a shirking of responsibility and ownership is different than a mentality.
