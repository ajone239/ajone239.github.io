<!-- intro -->
I recently came up against a moral quandary.
I love my cats; I have two, Tofu and Miso.
Not to belabor the point -- for two years while I was working from home we spent every day together.
I've had a recent change of jobs, and I now work in an office full time.
With this change, we spend considerably less time together.
I want my cats to have rich and full lives.
In researching how to enrich my cats, I came across so called "scavenge feeders".
The idea is that the cat has to find these little mice full of kibble and beat it out of them instead of having a proverbial bag of potato chips to mange on all day.
I have purchased and deployed these.

<!-- the question -->
The moral quandary is of the sort of that of a parent.
Where lies the boundary of my influence on these beings' lives.
Of course, they are cats, so as a "greater" being I have some responsibility to govern them.
However, what if they were my human children.
How does one exercise a good amount of control over another being such that the other being still gets to have a fulfilling existence?

<!-- debunk the easy answer -->
Well, what does it even mean to live a full life?
I think an easy thing to reach for is the hedonistic answer: pleasure max the animal life with food and play and comfort.
But would such a thing make us humans happy?
In talks of fulfillment, [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) is a common thing to reach for.
The classical problem with Maslow's Hierarchy of needs is that it is set up in a way where one layer precludes the others.
Hunger gates love.
Love gates aesthetic pursuit.
I think life is less linear than that.
When I live a fully-sated life, I feel less human to a degree that I have do things like fasting or cold showers or exercise to introduce stressors back into my life.

<!-- intro what I think the answer it -->
I think the question of what does it mean to live a good life is entwined with what it means to live a true life, to live resonantly with your nature.
Human individuals couldn't evolve fast enough to keep up with the rate the collective of them could change the world.
So many of us don't know what to do now that the "community" that we have is simultaneously wiped out and orders of magnitude bigger than we can understand.
But we can (thankfully) look at this and try to understand why it is discordant.

<!-- how the answer informs humans -->
We live in a world wrought with war and (recently at the time of writing) disease; I don't want to detract from the difficulty of living in the modern world.
But it's also much harder to die from lions or a malnutrition from lack of food and not social issues.
So in a reality where the bottom two levels of Maslow's hierarchy (physiology and safety) are met, I would posit that a sated person can often wonder "if this is it?".

<!-- wait wasn't this about cats? -->
Moreover, I want Tofu and Miso to have sate and comfortable lives, but I want them to have the joy of being a cat like I have the joy of being a human.
I think that takes a bit of a considered thought as to what it means to be a cat or maybe even a good cat.
By the same sword, some considered thought is required to figure out what it means to be a good human and then good person.
Listening to your nature and living accordingly -- I think struggle is good.
So, I really think that the cats having a little hunting to do will make them fill more fulfilled -- even if in a contrived way.
