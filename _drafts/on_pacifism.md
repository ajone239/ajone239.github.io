This draft is in response to a sentiment expressed by Sam Harris in "The End of Faith".

> Mine is that true pacifism is dumb ... because we live in a universe that contains violence and someone has to deal with it

I think this is a pretty obtuse argument.
We do live in a world with violence.

While yes, you could posit that violence is intrinsic to the universe in so far as we are self propagating chemical reactions that are competing for resources and "violence" is an umbrella term for that competition, I think we also live in a time where the self propagating chemical reactions are pretty sophisticated and can coordinate and collaborate pretty well.

Since we are able to reach the level of consciousness where we can observe the systems that we create and how they affect the world, it makes sense that a system that can come under fire is the system of violence in the world.

Just as people see the system of animal slaughter for food to be a useless system and there in don't pay into it.
People can see the system of violence as un-- or dare I say -- counter productive.
So that human who has viewed their world and considered it to be a worthwhile endeavor to live a life free of violence.

You have also viewed the systems at play and deemed working for your entire life as something you don't want to do.
So, you take steps to escape that system.
And oh how I tell you, "Take your kid to Baby Shark: on Ice: The Musical! 2" and "Eff it man get the good coffee".
I also respect your aspirations to retire early.

We aren't beholden to the same constraints as the hunters and the gatherers.
We can be peaceful and have cultures of collaboration.

To say it's "dumb" for a pacifist to take a beating instead of fighting their aggressor is reductive and obtuse.
It's dumb to not look at why this person believes in this thing.

Of course, as i have already ceded, I think there is so much space in the prosperous west for a "fake pacifist" to exist.
That's to say, one who doesn't believe in the minimizing of violence in the world but is afraid of engaging in such violence.
What I would consider a "real pacifist" isn't this person.


> Mine is that true pacifism is ... arguably less moral, because we live in a universe that contains violence and someone has to deal with it

Less moral than what? Killing the enemy? Massacring the other?

You are right that someone has to deal with the violence that exists.
Pacifism isn't about being walked over.
An example of a true pacifist and their movement is Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.
and the civil rights movement.

Peaceful sit-ins, non-violent protests, and persistent assertion that you are to be heard was a boon to the movement as it is very hard to dehumanize peaceful people.
Warring insurgents have to supplant the systems they rage against; integration is very hard between two violent bodies.

It is so often that through peaceful talks and collaboration that groups get along.
I understand that this isn't always possible, but it is an admirable thing to wish for.
