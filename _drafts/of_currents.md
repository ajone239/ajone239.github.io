<!-- TODO(austin.jones): make an intro -->

When I was about 20 or so, I decided to get into reading.
It was through a muddled mix of pretension and desire for slower media that I found myself opening books which is to say reading Dune on my phone.

At my first real job, I had a friend who was into personal development.
He was 27 at the time -- a wise elder to a recent college grad.
So, I asked him for a book recommendation.
He gave me, as any man has to give a boy, _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius, but he also recommended _Siddhartha_ by Hermann Hess.

Once you get past the fact that it is a book about Indian culture written by a German man, it's a decent read.
It has many themes about finding yourself and navigating through life.
Siddhartha leaves home to become an ascetic monk finding himself and enlightenment in the struggle.
Then, the eponymous character is able to wait for a good job since he has the ability to fast.
This shows, both metaphorically and literally, that hunger can be an inhibitor of opportunity.
He finds almost immediate success from his celebrated diligence.
However, he also becomes consumed by the base pleasures and debauchery that comes with his success showing no one is safe from temptation.
The question that has stuck with me the most from this book, and the question I want to discuss here, is, "What is the river?"

In a lot of ways, the themes of the book feel like a compass or navigation tools to leading a good life.
Themes and lessons can be used to orient and guide you through the problems you find outside them.
However, the operative phrase here is "can be used".
This packs into it a key point: the compass you are give _can_ be used if and only if you are able to use it.
It's obviously useless to say "you can't use what you aren't able to use".
But, the way that one isn't able to use a compass is apt to this discussion.

A map is wonderful navigation, given that you have oriented yourself.
So, one can has to fit the new map
