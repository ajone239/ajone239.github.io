I think a fun comparison is 求生 (search life) and the english word survive

so survive breaks down into sur + vive. sur is a latin root meaning over. vive similarly means latin for live. so survive mean to "over live" or live over and past other things. The word in its etymology is necessarily adversarial, meaning that the perspective baked into the work is living more than something.

This contrasts to 求生 which breaks down into searching and life. Searching can be a collaborative thing. We can search together with out having to squash those around us.

Fun how etymology can bake in philosophies of individualism vs collectivism.
