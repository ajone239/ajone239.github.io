title: On Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

_In a [recent blog post](), I made the statement that an issue with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is that it artificially gates levels from one another. The following post is a digestion of a conversation a colleague and I had diving into that premise.

Marco: I have to think about whether Maslow's really "gates" one level with another artificially.
You can enjoy a cold shower voluntarily.
Maslow's is for situations where there is no choice.
That is, I don't think that Maslow's precludes an individual privileging the aesthetic over the physiological but applies more when there is no choice.

If you want to enjoy a cold shower or enjoy having been lost for a little while, that's preferring one level over another but only because the other levels are covered.
You're not really in danger of freezing; you're not really in danger of not getting back to civilization.
You still get a frisson from the experience -- and it's psychologically helpful -- but that's exactly what Maslow's is all about.
When you're starving, you're absolutely not thinking about how a cold shower would help you gather your thoughts, feel more grounded, or think of an inventive solution to the problem you're noodling on.
You are scraping lichen off of a rock and trying to convince yourself that the rock would make a pretty good pillow.

Austin: But, don't you think that starving humans or refugees still have the capacity for love and aesthetic venture.
War torn countries still have poets in them to record what the war felt like over what happened in the war.
I doubt either of us have been truly hungry, so what do I know.
But I still feel that the human spirit perseveres, and I think that it means more to be a human than to hunt and gather.

In John Green's "The Fault in Our Stars", the main character is have a very, very close brush with cancer for the nth time.
Despite this they fall in love and find themselves etc.
etc.
This is fiction, but it does tell the story of using humanity to pull you through a struggle.
Maybe the hierarchy of needs can be restacked if precariously.
Or maybe I need a more absolutist view of the model.

Marco: Of course, of course, I agree that people can ignore privation on one level to focus on another level but only to a certain extent.
Gaza has more poets and philosophers, doctors and engineers per capita than many places, for example.
But I think if the level of privation rises above discomfort and goes to life-threatening, you are forced to focus on the lower levels again.
I wonder sometimes whether places that are really, really hot all the time could actually produce as much as those that aren't, simply because of how much more effort it takes to get through the day, just dealing with the weather.

If you have to carry water for hours a day just to survive, you're necessarily spending less time on the upper levels.
It doesn't mean that you spend no time there! Just that moving between those levels isn't as voluntary as it is for those of us who have never felt actual hunger.


Austin: Yeah, i think this is very fair.
because my "I can do my programming homework with a headache and an empty stomach" != "I've not eaten in 2 weeks and I need to make a fire"
