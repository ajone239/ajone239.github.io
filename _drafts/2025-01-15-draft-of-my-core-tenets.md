title: A tentative list of core tenets
author: Austin Jones

If you've had a long conversation with me, you've no doubt heard me say, "I need to write them down, but I have a few core tenets and _this_ is one of them...".
This is often followed by prattling about how the current situation is exemplifies how or why a value I hold is worthwhile.
Though it is already said in the title, it should go without saying that this list is tentative.
I'm still young, so I doubt my values are calcified yet.
All the same, the following is my list of core tenets.

# Empathy

A little empathy goes a long way.
Day after day, time after time: I find that empathy is what deepens and enriches my relationships with others.
Really trying to get what another person is going through often brings you closer to that person.
Emotions are human, and it is a truly human link that you can form with someone trying to feel what they feel.

This isn't to say that you have to agree with everyone and have a constantly bleeding heart.
Empathy isn't sympathy.
However, leading with grace and understanding with make you a kinder person.

# Talk shit get hit

If you run your mouth, you are implicitly consenting to the consequences.
This is not to stifle the running of ones mouth; bragging and displays of strength are a part of us.
This is also not to encourage only piping up when you have a water tight boast.

This is meant to encourage the due humility of process.
This is meant to encourage the mutual reverence that colleagues should have for one another.
This is meant to highlight the sword of Damocles dangling over the heads of all who brag.
There is always someone better at something than you, so be humble.

# Game recognizes game

While, I don't wish to convey myself as quirky -- I'm certainly a little eccentric.
However, I find that often people see through the "not wearing shoes at his desk" and find a (hopefully) good engineer/man/person.
I too find that I have no problem offering people piecemeal appreciation.
I might not care for your politics, but you could be a great shoe cobbler.

"Game recognizing game" is about some intrinsic bond between people of dedication.
And at that not necessarily of the same guild.
I love to talk to people who are passionate about their work.
All of life is a game: business, people, love, art, programming.
It's all a game.
I _love_ to hear how people play it -- especially when they play it well.
I'd prefer to talk to an artist whose fingers ache from the 100th iteration of a painting than a programmer who only knows one language.

# It will all workout because it has to

I worry allot -- like a [diagnosable amount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder).
Woefully, I don't always practice what I preach.
But, from me to you, wherever you are: It will be okay.

It has always worked out.
The stock market goes up.
The population rises.
Even if we all get wiped out like the dinosaurs, something will take our place like we did to them.
Time is a big thing; enjoy these winds in your sails.

# Kindness is [Pog](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pog)

Leading with kindness has never made mine or someone else's day worse.
I've been making bread recently and giving it to friends.
The joy on people's faces is always worth it.
Be kind.

# Everyone deserves a friend

Life can be lonely, very lonely.
I've been lonely, and I'd bet that you have been before as well.
Even the deepest hermit of an introvert wants the presence of another even periodically.
Loneliness can also do awful things to a person.
Isolation is a deep pit.

So I really think everyone deserves a friend.
Everyone should have someone who wants to be around them and enjoy them.
Even if the person is annoying -- taking sometime out of your day to give them could change their life.

# In everything said, there is something to be heard

# Own your mistakes

# No conditional apologies

Maybe this comes from being a programmer or from having had a partner for a long time, but conditional apologies are hollow.
The point of an apology is to show remorse for an action, remorse for an outcome has no ownership

```rust
let remorse = if offended.upset {
    offense.gravity
} else {
    0
};

offender.grow_from(remorse);
```

To paraphrase my partner: a conditional apology doesn't mean you feel bad for having done the action, it means that you feel bad for how the offended party's reaction made you feel.
In line with the previous tenet, apologies for your actions not the results and grow from them.

# Make community wherever you go

# You could probably use more fiber (in diet and media)

# You never know the situations that have brought a person to you so be kind

# Say what is on your mind, if it ends the relationship it was going to happen

# The love of the game

# _You_ have to fight for your right to party
