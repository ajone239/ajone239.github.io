<!-- intro -->
I like frozen grapes.
They're a bit of a comfort food for me.
My first step mother loved frozen grapes.
When she was pregnant with my little, half brother, all she wanted was too sweet kool-aid, frozen grapes, and the (soon to decline) Subway sub sandwiches.

<!--

-->
One summer day, she took my then stepbrother and me to said sandwich shop.
She ordered her sandwich last.
Once it was assembled, she asked for "oil and vinegar... extra oil" as her dressing for her sandwich.
After the sandwich maker had fully dressed her sub, she said, "Could you put more oil on the sandwich?"
He obliged.
She asked for more.
He obliged.
She asked him to go until she stopped him.

<!-- intro of the main conflict -->
After a fight her and my biological father had, my step mother confided in me (as much as you can confide in a 10 year old) that she was "done with [my biological father]'s _crap_".
"But," I asked, "aren't you guys in love?"
She said, "I love your dad very much, but I just don't like him anymore."
She was joking when she said this, of course.
However, they were soon after divorced.

<!-- hook -->
I've long since been afraid of being more lovable than likeable.

<!-- elaborate on love vs like -->
You like jello.
You love your mom.
To like is to derive joy from, to affine toward someone, to be pleased.
To love is to care, to know, to accept the faults for the being therein.
You don't have to like your mom.
You do have to love her.

<!-- make the problem visceral -->
Without sugaring, I'm afraid of being my dad.
My step mom meant that my biological father had gotten her to care for him -- she was invested.
But he failed to bring her joy.
He failed to deliver on the promises he made.

<!-- intro to the meat -->
But was does this fear actually comprise?
I think in part it is a pragmatic fear of disservicing people you love.
As you can tell from the term of endearment "biological father", he and I likely aren't on exactly _liking_ terms either.
I have been through the fun cycle of trying to love someone of them being unlikable.
The thought of putting others through that _scares_ me.

<!-- thesis -->
I think a less pragmatic and more stifling constituent of this fear is a fear of weakness.
I'm afraid of needing your love.
And no, I'm not afraid of "needing your love" like I might do in a song from the 80's.
I'm afraid of needing your your love, because maybe without out it, I'm just not likeable enough -- I just don't provided enough value.
It feels that to be allowed to win is to be lied to.
If someone puts up with your unfunny jokes you are being cheated from experience.
I fear that the things done in the name of love will expose my own weakness.

<!-- why a fear of weakness breeds more weakness -->
However, a fear of weakness is something that _counterintuitively_ makes and keeps you week.
If you are afraid of weakness, you will find yourself unable to take the proper steps to get stronger.
If you deign half push-ups as weak yet can't do a full one, you are needlessly stifling your ability to get work on you strength.
Things like asking questions, accepting help, or relying on other may be "weak".
More often though, they can be an enabling step for people to grow.
I don't think any of us taught ourselves to read.
All the same the narrative of, "I'm $x years old, I shouldn't have to ask for help with $y," is something that stifles people of all ages from learning and growing.

<!-- why a fear of weakness is unproductive -->
Something I've been working on is accepting love.
"Taking up space" is what I've been referring to it as.
There has long been discourse on making room for others and giving love.
Somehow, this has created a generation of people who love to give and have no one to give it to.

This could sound stupid: e.g. "just accept love man -- let people do stuff for you."
But, I was taught to be helpful, to be self sufficient, and to not trouble others.
This creates someone who wants to have people over but won't accept help cleaning up.
This creates a person who eventually resents the people they are "serving".
Society, and likewise love, requires give and take.
