I've recently started my first Dungeons and Dragons campaign.
It's a game that I've long coveted to play.
My character is a Wizard named Thaddeus Snaatch.

I have found _Fire Bolt_ to be indispensable and _Magic Missiles_ to put a bow on most enemies.
However, I've only felt well covered in combat.
In role play and general adventuring, I feel lost -- not _lost_ but lost _as Thaddeus_.
I don't know what he wants, thinks, or is looking for in the world.
So, as the titular questions asks, _Who is Thaddeus Snaatch?_

Where does he come from?
====================

The Snaatch family has a pedigree whose depth is only rivaled by its purity.
An old wizarding family with a long standing tradition in the practice of Abjuration.
Heralded as the "Iron Dome of Deloria", the Snaatch family has a history deep entwined with the proud city of Deloria.
As the settlement was budding into a township, it was the Snaatch family's charms, wards, and banishings that kept its denizens safe.
With time, Deloira grew into the city we know it as now, in step the protection evolved with the city.
As veritable "founders", the Snaatch family naturally grew with its city and, more appropriately, its magic.
Protection can't be free; even if it has no price, the protector will always garner favor from the protected.

In the old times of war or siege, the "Iron Dome" is loved by every inhabitant of the city.
It offers an nearly infallible defense from all the assailants, and those who get through the wall won't be in this realm for much longer.

In the old times of peace, the proverbial _Dome_ held strong.
Our benevolent guild of protectors split their time between:
maintaining the guard with understood languor,
using the well funneled taxes to fund universities that further advance magic (mainly their magic),
and offering private protection -- at a premium of course.

However, we find ourselves in _new_ times of peace.
In these new times, the _Dome_ grows thinner over the heads of anyone who doesn't have deep pockets or elvish blood.
It seems the Snaatches are much less concerned with the "Iron Dome" they once upheld.
Their attention now turns enriching their practices, their bottom lines, and their lineage.
For those who are kept out of the proverbial rain, the Snaatch family is _old, rich, mature, the *old* guard_.
For the rest of the city, the iron has long tarnished and has been pejoratively replaced with platinum.
One must wonder, in times of such peace, what are we keeping out?
By the same sword, it seems that everyone but those inside of it can see the odd lines the new "Platinum Dome" draws.

...

This is where our hero comes in.
Thaddeus J Snaatch VII is anything but his father's son.
