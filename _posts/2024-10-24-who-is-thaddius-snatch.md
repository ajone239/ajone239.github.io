title: Who is Thaddeus Snaatch?
categories: dnd fiction
---

I've recently started my first Dungeons and Dragons campaign.
It's a game that I've long coveted to play.
My character is a Wizard named Thaddeus Snaatch.

I have found _Fire Bolt_ to be indispensable and _Magic Missiles_ to put a bow on most enemies.
However, I've only felt well covered in combat.
In role play and general adventuring, I feel lost -- not _lost_ but lost _as Thaddeus_.
I don't know what he wants, thinks, or is looking for in the world.
So, as the titular questions asks, _Who is Thaddeus Snaatch?_

Where does he come from?
====================

The Snaatch

Why is he a Wizard?

What has him down on his luck?
====================

Why is he in this ragtag group or misfits?
