title: Hey! Weren't you doing advent of code?
author: Austin Jones

Great question.
Yeah, I was, and I was blogging about it -- I even wrote a [supplementary meta-article]({% link _posts/2024-12-10-yes-im-doing-advent-of-code.md %}).
Below are all the links to my posts/code.

There isn't really a sexy reason as to why I stopped -- I got busy.
There were year end tasks at work.
There was prep for Christmas.
Life is finds a way of picking up and keeping you busy.

If I can offer any wisdom from my second failed attempt at Advent of Code, it comes from my other favourite daily month challenge: [Inktober](https://inktober.com).
It is as much a challenge of self expression as it is planning.
Planning out 31 drawings and for that matter 50 small coding projects is a hard thing to do.

It's ever important to remember that to "fail" at Advent of Code isn't to fail.
The goal in the aforementioned article was to have fun, not to stimulate my perfectionism.
I did it until it wasn't fun to do it while maintaining my life -- that's that.
In a weird way, it's quite the success.
