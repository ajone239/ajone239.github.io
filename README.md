# Svelte

This was made with Svelte and was heavily influenced by [this post](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) by [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/about-me).
## Developing

Once you've pulled the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
