Accepting help can seem like it is for _the weak_.
However, it is an important step in progressing though life.
The process of learning how to accept this help can show you how to value yourself.
Giving and accepting graces are two sides of the same coin.
Working to learn them both with benefit you and society.

Notes:

- Think of how things read not how they sound.
    + Address sentence structure
    + too many interjections
- Show your work more
    + tell stories about how you've had to overcome accepting love
    + Too matter of fact in tone
    + why should anyone listen to this?
    + make it more personal
- tie in the beginning to the end
    + treat the essay as a running track
- the second half of the essay fetas
- 2 essay problems:
    + an essay about overcoming perfectionism through self acceptance
    + an essay about how you have to develop self trust to work on accepting love.
    + these kinda touch tips in the way that the
        * parental annecdotes show that I know what weakness and “bummness” looks like
        * the therapy anecdote shows how that manifested into a grindset but idk if that’s clear to a not me reader

<!-- intro -->
I love snacking on frozen grapes.
They're a bit of a comfort food for me.
My first step mother loved frozen grapes.
When she was pregnant with my little, half brother, all she wanted was too-sweet-Kool-Aid, frozen grapes, and the (soon to decline) Subway sub sandwiches.

<!--
creates tension for someone being under served
even in a situation where someone is asking for alot
-->
One summer day, she took my then stepbrother and me to said sandwich shop.
She ordered her sandwich last.
Once it was assembled, she asked for "oil and vinegar... extra oil" as her dressing for her sandwich.
After the sandwich maker had fully dressed her sub, she said, "Could you put more oil on the sandwich?"
He obliged.
She asked for more.
He obliged.
She asked him to go until she stopped him.

<!-- intro of the main conflict -->
After a fight her and my biological father had, my step mother confided in me (as much as you can confide in a 10 year old) that she was "done with [my biological father]'s _crap_".
"But," I asked, "aren't you guys in love?"
She said, "I love your dad very much, but I just don't like him anymore."
She was joking when she said this, of course.
However, they were soon after divorced.

<!-- hook -->
I've long since been afraid of being more lovable than likeable.

<!-- elaborate on love vs like -->
<!-- make the problem visceral -->
Without sugaring it, I'm afraid of being my dad.
You like jello.
You love your mom.
To like is to derive joy from, to affine toward someone, to be pleased.
To love is to care, to know, to accept the faults for the being therein.
My step mom meant that my biological father had gotten her to care for him -- she was invested.
But he failed to bring her joy.
He failed to deliver on the promises he made.

<!-- intro to the meat -->
But what does this fear actually comprise?
I think, in part, it is a pragmatic fear of disservicing people you love.
As you can tell from the term of endearment "biological father", he and I aren't on exactly _liking_ terms either.
I have been through the fun cycle of trying to love someone despite them being chronically unlikable.
The thought of putting others through that _scares_ me.

<!-- thesis: learning to accept and give love is important -->
I think a less pragmatic and more stifling constituent is a fear of weakness.
I'm afraid of needing your love.
And no, I'm not afraid of "needing your love" like I might do in a song from the 80's.
I'm afraid of needing your love, because maybe without out it, I'm just not likeable enough -- I just don't provided enough value.
It feels that to be allowed to win is to be lied to.
If someone puts up with your unfunny jokes you are being cheated from experience.
I fear that the things done in the name of love will coddle my own weaknesses.

<!-- how do i go easy on myself without being a bum -->
A reservation I had before I started therapy was something to the tune of, "what if my issues that I have _make_ me hardworking and good at problem solving."
That's shockingly untrue looking at it from the other side, however, "The drugs make me creative," is a common refrain with artists.
This worry morphed from "anxiety makes me smart" into "I'm afraid to give myself any slack because I'll become a bum."
In many ways this is a valid concern:

- The aforementioned progenitor of mine _is a bum_.
- Pre-therapy (and alot of other self-work), anytime I wasn't going full tilt, I was going no tilt.

While valid, they are equally refutable:

- See [learning with counter examples](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242678752_Using_Counter-Examples_to_Enhance_Learners%27_Understanding_of_Undergraduate_Mathematics).
- One might surmise that I was going **no tilt** to _rest_ from going **full tilt**.

Nevertheless, this doubt rings of the same fear of accepting love, though in an internalised way.
I can't accept love or grace from myself as that would make me weak.
That would hamper the value I add to myself.
That would let me slip into a relationship with myself where I'm just tolerating my flaws.

<!-- why a fear of weakness breeds more weakness -->
However, a fear of weakness is something that _counterintuitively_ makes and keeps you weak.
If you are afraid of weakness, you will find yourself unable to take the proper steps to get stronger.
If you deign half push-ups as weak and yet can't do a full one, you are needlessly stifling your ability to get work on you strength.
Things like asking questions, accepting help, or relying on other may be "weak".
More often though, they can be an enabling step for people to grow.

<!-- what it boils down to -->
This could all sound stupid: e.g. "just accept love man -- let people do stuff for you," but I don't think it is as simple as "just" and "let make it out to be.
What this all seems to boil down to then is: a lack of self trust and a lack of self worth.
You won't accept help, because you don't trust yourself to work to ween off it.
You won't accept love, because you don't think you give people enough value to earn it.
This might all sound dramatic, but I think it is the fall out from the strategy: "I will never have debt if I never owe anyone anything."
Economics live in all things; social interactions aren't safe from this.
There is always (even if only implicit) a social ledger that tallies how much "worth" a person has to you.
This is simultaneously reductive and complex.
None the less, it is true.

<!-- Loving yourself DBT -->
But, how do we keep the ledger balanced?
How do we know how much help is too much or too little?
In short, you don't.
You can start to feel this out though by introspecting into how you balance this relationship with yourself.
You are your own customer, as it were.
If you dish out to much grace or abuse the grace you extend yourself, you will become a bum.
Similarly, if you are your own warden or don't rest, you will drain yourself dry.
Internally, self worth and self trust start to blend.
The amount that you value yourself and the confidence you have in yourself aren't that different.

So, how do you start to loving yourself?
I think the two steps from [DBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy).
This therapy emphasizes "acceptance and change".
You "accept" where you are in terms of trust with yourself.
You then work to "change" and improve that facet of the relationship.
What this really does (besides the self improvement) is give you a stage for proving you to yourself.
This is the stage upon which you will grow your trust with yourself and then your value.

In my experience, the fear of becoming a "bum" is quashed by the gained effectiveness of allowed rest.
As I said above, I would swap from redlining to hibernating.
These hibernations were often extended by the fact that I couldn't stand the thought of being so useless.
In the same way that I don't judge myself for resting on the couch after a run, I learned to not judge myself for resting my brain after hard studying.
Without this dissonance, I can rest and recover better.
By resting better and more, I can perform better.
Peace, grace, and acceptance are invaluable tools in fighting this issues.

<!-- Accepting Others' Love -->
In light of getting more comfortable giving myself grace, something I've been working on is accepting love.
"Taking up space" is what I've been referring to it as.
There has long been discourse on making room for others and giving love.
There is little talk of taking up space.
Society, and likewise love, requires give and take.
Host a book club, but do let people bring food.
Let your friend help you move, but take them out to dinner or host them.
Accept help from a mentor, then mentor those who look to you.
One's role in a community or society is a wholistic one.

<!-- Conclusion -->
It's understandable to be afraid of leaning on others.
It's isn't something that is particularly taught or encouraged.
However, not letting yourself be helped or not even helping yourself is an impediment if not something that will make you weaker.
It is the avoidance of the reality of your situation that is encouraged by the fear of weakness or fear of accepting help/love.
It is only through the engagement with this reality that you can overcome this fear from where you are.
