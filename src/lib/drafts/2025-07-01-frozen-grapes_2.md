What's my thesis?

What am I trying to say?

- I felt for a long time that you have to be likeable before you can be loveable.
- It felt like resting in someone's love would allow me to fall into their distaste.
- this sort of generalizes
    + love -> grace
    + like -> value
- for me, this corrodes from working to being likeable into a fear of love.
- for me, this turns into a cagey effort to hold onto all likability
- worse yet it turns into an unwillingness to accept love form inside or out
- This left me in a local maximum
- I had to learn how to accept love

How am I going to try to say it?

<!-- intro -->
I love frozen white grapes; they're a bit of a comfort food for me.
When my first step mother was pregnant with my little, half brother, all she wanted was too-sweet-Kool-Aid, frozen grapes, and Subway.
One summer day, she took my then stepbrother and me to said sandwich shop.
She ordered her sandwich last; she asked for "oil and vinegar... extra oil" as her sandwich dressing.
After the sandwich maker had fully dressed her sub, she said, "Could you put more oil on the sandwich?"
He obliged.
She asked for more--he obliged.
She asked him to go until she stopped him.

After a fight she and my biological father had, my step mother confided in me (as much as you can confide in a 10 year old) that she was "done with [my biological father]'s _crap_".
"But," I asked, "aren't you guys in love?"
She said, "I love your dad very much, but I just don't like him anymore."
She was joking when she said this, of course.
However, they were soon after divorced.

<!-- hook -->
I've long since been afraid of being more lovable than likeable.
Without sugaring it, I'm afraid of being my dad.
My step mom meant that my biological father had gotten her to care for him -- she was invested.
But he failed to bring her joy.
He failed to deliver on the promises he made.

But what does this fear actually comprise?
I think, in part, it is a pragmatic fear of disservicing people you love.
As you can tell from the term of endearment "biological father", he and I aren't on exactly _liking_ terms either.
I have been through the fun cycle of trying to love someone despite them being chronically unlikable.
The thought of putting others through that _scares_ me.

<!-- thesis: learning to accept and give love is important -->
I think a less pragmatic and more stifling constituent is a fear of weakness.
I'm afraid of needing your love.
And no, I'm not afraid of "needing your love" like I might do in a song from the 80's.
I'm afraid of needing your love, because maybe without out it, I'm just not likeable enough -- I just don't provided enough value.
It feels that to be allowed to win is to be lied to.
If someone puts up with your unfunny jokes you are being cheated from experience.
I fear that the things done in the name of love will coddle my own weaknesses.



<!-- conclusion talk about how comfort is allowed and how comfort is frozen grapes-->
